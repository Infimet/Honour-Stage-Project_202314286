Teaching programming using a robot (real or virtual) (NAG-25-953) This project will consider how to teach some of the key aspects of programming to novices - the target group being school pupils, but this could be expanded for any novice programmers. The robot could be a turtle or more complex robot, that is programmed in a virtual environment.
